# Hacks: Small useful things

I often write little throwaway tools when I am working. Occasionally, I write the same tool more than once, at which point I try to turn it into a more serious thing. This is my collection of them. These are for me, but I'm making this public and open source in case they are helpful to others.


## timeparse: parse a time into local, UTC, and unix times

Attempts to guess what format a time is in, and converts it to local time, UTC, and unix timestamps. Example:

```
$ go run ./timeparse 'Sat Dec 12 13:27:44 EST 2020'
Sat Dec 12 13:27:44 EST 2020 (unix_date)
  LOCAL: 2020-12-12T13:27:44-05:00  UTC: 2020-12-12T18:27:44Z  UNIX EPOCH: 1607797664
```


## makeflaky: pause a process to make tests flaky

Many tests are flaky because they depend on real time, or other scheduling order between threads. This tool sends SIGSTOP/SIGCONT signals to temporarily pause and resume a process, which causes tests to run much slower, like they do on slow CI servers. Use `--stopPeriod` to adjust the length of the pause. Example:

```
$ go run makeflaky.go --stopPeriod=20ms 6034
2020/12/22 16:55:04 slowing down pid=6034; runPeriod=10ms; stopPeriod=20ms (33.3% duty cycle)...
2020/12/22 16:55:49 sent 1307 signals
```


## protodecode: decode protocol buffer bytes without a schema

This is useful for debugging raw data that contains a protocol buffer, but you aren't sure which. It can also partially decode corrupt or invalid protocol buffer messages. This makes it useful for debugging! Example:

```$ go run ./protodecode --nested=4 out
bytes 0-11: field=1 type=0 (varint) uint=9223372036854775808
bytes 11-25: field=2 type=2 (length-delimited) len=12 str="HÃ©llo ðŸŒŽ!" hex=48c3a96c6c6f20f09f8c8e21
bytes 25-39: field=4 type=2 (length-delimited) len=12 nested message
  bytes 27-33: field=1 type=0 (varint) uint=1607863096
  bytes 33-39: field=2 type=0 (varint) uint=437553000
```


## postgrestmp: start a temporary postgres shell

Creates a new Postgres database in a temporary directory, then runs the psql command line utility to connect to it. When psql exits, the database is deleted. Example:

```
$ go run ./postgrestmp 
initializing temporary postgres database in /var/folders/s_/cmjk7jmx445cbktl7q_p2z0r0000gn/T/postgrestmp_707622637 ...

[... postgres output omitted ...]

```

## httpping: Time HTTP(s) requests

Executes a sequence of HTTP GET requests to a URL and reports some average statistics about the requests. It also logs the individual requests which are slower than a given threshold. I think I used this to get some average latency numbers, and to check for slow request outliers.

```
$ go run ./httpping https://www.google.com/
